(Update: I removed my code for the class assignments from this repository since some of my code for this class can be used as a solution to future classes on the same subject, and hence might be subjected to the Honor Code.

Coursework for Functional Programming, written in SML.

This is a repository containing my coursework to the second part of the gateway to computer science major, in Functional Programming at Wesleyan University, written in SML under Professor Daniel R. Licata. This coursework discusses about the basics of functional programming and introduces me to the concepts of representations of datatypes in functional programming. Class assignments and projects make heavy use of functional programming to some real-life examples, including n-body simulation and machine learning.

Topics discussed in class include:
- Structural Induction
- Totality and Valuability
- Asymptotic Analysis
- Sequential and Parallel Sorting
- Polymorphisms and Options
- Higher Order Functions
- Sequences as a data representation
- Modules, Signatures and Structures
- Types Abstraction
- Functors and Types Classes
- Tail Recursive Functions, Continuations
- Scheduling
- Effects

Class assignments and projects include:

- Basic mathematics in functional programming (including prefix-sum and subset-sum)
- Quicksort using tree representation (with a optimized implementation for the time bounds)
- Functions (map, reduce, flatten, mapreduce)
- Creating shapes using functional programming (also concepts of bounding boxes, translations)
- n-Body Simulation (using Barnes-Hut algorithm, a practice for sequences, and implementations of both real and rational vectors for testing)
- Modules (for pixel transformations)
- Machine Learning (Extract-combine, Bayesian classifications)
